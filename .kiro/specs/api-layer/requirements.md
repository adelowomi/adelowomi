# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive API layer to the existing Next.js application to support dynamic content management for events, user registrations, gallery images, videos, and admin functionality. The current application has static components that need to be connected to a backend API to enable full CRUD operations and data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to view current event information dynamically, so that I can see up-to-date event details and register for events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display current event information fetched from the API
2. WHEN a user clicks on an event THEN the system SHALL display detailed event information including date, time, venue, and description

4. WHEN no events are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to register for events through a form, so that I can participate in upcoming events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
2. WHEN form validation passes THEN the system SHALL save the registration data to the database
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
4. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a user tries to register for a full event THEN the system SHALL prevent registration and show capacity message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage events through an admin interface, so that I can create, update, and delete events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new event THEN the system SHALL save the event with all required details
2. WHEN an admin updates an event THEN the system SHALL modify the existing event data
3. WHEN an admin deletes an event THEN the system SHALL remove the event and associated registrations
4. WHEN an admin views events THEN the system SHALL display all events with pagination
5. WHEN an admin searches for events THEN the system SHALL filter events based on search criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view and manage event registrations, so that I can track attendees and manage capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views registrations THEN the system SHALL display all registrants for a specific event
2. WHEN an admin exports registrations THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable report
3. WHEN an admin searches registrations THEN the system SHALL filter results by name, email, or other criteria
4. WHEN viewing registrations THEN the system SHALL show pagination for large datasets
5. WHEN an event reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically close registration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage gallery images for events, so that I can showcase event photos to visitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads images THEN the system SHALL store images to Google Drive with proper organization
2. WHEN an admin associates images with events THEN the system SHALL link Google Drive image URLs to specific events
3. WHEN an admin deletes images THEN the system SHALL remove images from Google Drive and database references
4. WHEN visitors view gallery THEN the system SHALL display images organized by event, loaded from Google Drive
5. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL organize them in Google Drive folders by event and generate shareable links

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage video content, so that I can share event recordings and promotional videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads videos THEN the system SHALL store video files to Google Drive with proper organization
2. WHEN an admin adds video metadata THEN the system SHALL save title, description, category information and Google Drive links
3. WHEN an admin organizes videos THEN the system SHALL allow categorization by content type and event in Google Drive folders
4. WHEN visitors view videos THEN the system SHALL stream videos efficiently from Google Drive
5. WHEN videos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL organize them in Google Drive folders and generate shareable streaming links

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view dashboard analytics, so that I can monitor website activity and event performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current statistics for events, images, and videos
2. WHEN viewing dashboard metrics THEN the system SHALL show registration counts and trends
3. WHEN analyzing event performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights on popular events
4. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display real-time or near real-time data
5. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states or error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an admin, I want secure authentication, so that only authorized users can access admin functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin attempts to login THEN the system SHALL validate credentials against stored user data
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL create a secure session or JWT token
3. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication status
4. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
5. WHEN logout is requested THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN client requests fail THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN file uploads fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
5. WHEN system monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-structured API endpoints, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions
2. WHEN data is exchanged THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON response formats
3. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL implement input validation and sanitization
4. WHEN database queries are made THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance using a suitable ORM
5. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear endpoint documentation

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data persistence, so that application data is stored securely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs data storage THEN the system SHALL use MySQL as the primary database
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use a suitable ORM for type safety and query optimization
3. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support migrations for version control
